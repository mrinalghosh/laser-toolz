# laser-toolz

Tools to generate and manipulate SVGs for the Epilog laser cutter.

## linify — image → laser-ready SVG line art

Convert any raster image into **continuous hairline SVG lines** for laser
cutting / perforation. Six interchangeable render modes, one parametric CLI,
plus an optional local web UI for live experimentation.

Everything is built around one non-negotiable rule: **the laser ignores stroke
width, so tone is encoded by _geometry only_** — displacement, spacing, or
contours — never by line thickness or color.

## Why the output looks the way it does (laser constraints)

- **Every line is a hairline.** Fixed `stroke-width` (default `0.02mm`),
  `fill:none`, a single stroke color (default `black`; use `--color red` for a
  cut layer). Width is *not* a tonal variable.
- **Continuous paths, no dashes.** You add perforation in LightBurn / your
  laser software. Output is plain `<path>` polylines.
- **Real-world units.** SVG `width`/`height` carry a real physical size with a
  matching `viewBox`, so a `--width-mm 200` request imports as exactly 200 mm
  wide in LightBurn / Illustrator. Height is derived from the image aspect ratio.
  Pass `--units in` (or `cm`) to relabel the header for inch-only software — the
  geometry is untouched, so an 8-inch file still imports at true scale.

## Install

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate
pip install pillow numpy scikit-image   # scikit-image (+ its scipy) needed for contour, flow, tsp, glyph
pip install freetype-py                  # only for glyph mode (reads glyph outlines from fonts)
pip install flask                        # only for the optional web UI
```

## Quick start

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o out.svg --mode wavy      # zero tuning needed
```

## The seven modes

### 1. `wavy` — displaced scanlines (the "face-in-lines" look)

Horizontal carrier waves; **darkness modulates the wiggle amplitude** (dark =
big wiggle). Amplitude is clamped to `< line-spacing/2` so adjacent lines can
never cross.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o wavy.svg --mode wavy \
    --line-spacing 2 --wavelength 8 --amp 1

# add subject isolation (blank background) + frequency modulation in shadows
python linify.py sample.png -o wavy.svg --mode wavy \
    --mask-threshold 0.9 --freq-mod
```

**Getting contrast out of it.** Amplitude alone is a weak tonal cue (line count
and spacing are identical in light and dark; only the wiggle size changes), and a
shared phase makes every bulge line up into vertical banding. Two pure-geometry
knobs fix that:

- **`--amp-gamma`** (`<1`, try `0.5`) lifts midtones up the amplitude curve, so
  mid-gray actually wiggles hard instead of rippling gently. The default linear
  map only nears full swing at pure black, which is why untuned output looks flat.
- **`--phase-jitter`** (`0..1`, try `0.5`) gives each scanline its own phase so
  bulges stop aligning into columns — the surface reads as woven, organic ink.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o wavy.svg --mode wavy \
    --amp-gamma 0.5 --phase-jitter 0.6
```

### 2. `spacing` — density lines

Horizontal lines that **pack closer in dark regions** and spread apart in light
ones. Implemented by walking top→bottom, accumulating a darkness integral, and
emitting a line each time it crosses a threshold. `--spacing-style` chooses how
the horizontal axis is used — the difference between an outline and a full
tonal rendering:

- **`clean`** (default): vertical packing is driven by each row's mean darkness,
  giving crisp continuous horizontal lines, then each line is **clipped to the
  columns locally dark enough to want it** — so lines break across light gaps and
  terminate at the subject. You get the **silhouette / form**, clean enough to
  cut, with no internal noise.
- **`density`**: every column carries its own accumulator, so ink lands
  per-(row, column) — dark columns fire often and fuse into horizontal runs,
  light columns stay bare. This recovers **internal shading** (a real tonal
  portrait) at the cost of a **dithery / broken** look near tonal boundaries.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o spacing.svg --mode spacing \
    --min-spacing 0.6 --max-spacing 4 --spacing-style clean

python linify.py sample.png -o spacing.svg --mode spacing \
    --spacing-style density        # detailed shading, dottier
```

### 3. `contour` — topographic iso-lines

Quantizes brightness into `--levels` bands and traces each iso-brightness
contour with `skimage.measure.find_contours`. Organic, follows the form (the
displacement-map look).

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o contour.svg --mode contour \
    --levels 8 --smooth 1.5 --min-contour-len 3
```

### 4. `filet` — crochet grid (filled vs. open cells)

Quantizes the image into a grid of **filled and open cells**, exactly like a
[filet crochet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Filet_crochet) chart. The image is
divided into `--cells-wide` columns (rows derived to keep cells square); a cell
becomes **filled** when its mean darkness clears `--fill-threshold`, and open
cells stay empty mesh windows. Tone is binary and **purely geometric** — a
filled cell carries a *mark*, never a heavier stroke.

The mesh lattice (every cell border) is drawn as long continuous horizontal and
vertical hairlines — real filet mesh, and efficient laser travel. `--fill-style`
picks how a filled cell reads:

- **`x`** (default): two diagonals — the classic filet chart cross.
- **`cross`**: a `+` (mid vertical + horizontal).
- **`hatch`**: `--hatch-lines` parallel diagonals packed into the cell — the most
  solid / tonal look.

`--no-mesh` (or enabling `--mask-threshold`) drops the background lattice so only
filled cells are drawn, each with its own outline, floating on blank ground.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o filet.svg --mode filet \
    --cells-wide 60 --fill-threshold 0.5 --fill-style x

# solid tonal blocks, no background grid, isolated subject
python linify.py sample.png -o filet.svg --mode filet \
    --cells-wide 48 --fill-style hatch --hatch-lines 4 --no-mesh --mask-threshold 0.85
```

### 5. `flow` — edge-tangent hatching

Short **streamlines that flow *along* the form** — around the eyes, down the
jaw, following folds — the way an illustrator lays down contour hatching. The
direction field comes from the *smoothed structure tensor* (not the raw
gradient), so it stays coherent even across noisy flat regions. **Tone is stroke
density**: each seed on a jittered grid survives with probability
`darkness**flow-gamma`, so strokes crowd into shadows and thin out in
highlights. Never stroke width — pure geometry.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o flow.svg --mode flow \
    --flow-spacing 1.4 --flow-len 7 --flow-smooth 6

# denser, longer, more coherent strokes; lift midtones for fuller coverage
python linify.py sample.png -o flow.svg --mode flow \
    --flow-spacing 1.0 --flow-len 12 --flow-smooth 10 --flow-gamma 0.6
```

- **`--flow-smooth`** is the coherence knob: higher averages the flow direction
  over a wider area (smoother, calmer lines), lower follows fine detail and noise.
- **`--flow-spacing`** sets seed pitch (hatching density); **`--flow-len`** sets
  how long each stroke runs before it stops — short reads as a woven stipple,
  long as flowing ink.

### 6. `tsp` — single continuous line

The **whole image in one unbroken stroke**. The picture is first *stippled* into
dots whose density tracks darkness (`--points` of them, weighted by
`--point-gamma`), then every dot is joined into a single **traveling-salesman
path**: seeded along a **Hilbert space-filling curve** (which never makes a long
jump-back edge), then cleaned up with interleaved neighbor-limited **2-opt +
or-opt** (`--tsp-improve` passes) — 2-opt uncrosses, or-opt relocates the strays
2-opt can't reach. The output is exactly **one `<path>`** — ideal for a single
continuous cut/engrave with no pen-up.

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o tsp.svg --mode tsp \
    --points 4000 --tsp-improve 2

# denser line, isolated subject, midtones lifted for fuller shading
python linify.py sample.png -o tsp.svg --mode tsp \
    --points 8000 --point-gamma 0.7 --tsp-improve 3 --mask-threshold 0.9
```

- **`--points`** trades detail for compute: more dots = a longer, denser line
  and a slower tour.
- **`--tsp-improve`** `0` is the raw Hilbert seed (fast, some gap-crossing
  edges); `2–4` refines it into a cleaner line — each extra pass shortens the
  longest jumps at some CPU cost, plateauing once the tour is locally optimal.

Stippling is darkness-weighted rejection sampling (dot density is tone-accurate
but not blue-noise), and the tour is a heuristic, not an optimal TSP solution —
both are chosen so a few-thousand-dot portrait renders in well under a second.

### 7. `glyph` — ASCII / Unicode line art (needs `freetype-py`)

A grid of **characters** whose ink density tracks tone — an ASCII-art portrait,
except every glyph is drawn as the font's **own vector outline** (crisp
hairlines, no tracing), so it's laser-native. Each glyph in the palette is
analyzed once: `freetype-py` hands over its native outline *and* rasterizes it so
the mode can **rank glyphs by ink coverage** (light → dark) and **tag each one's
dominant stroke orientation**. Every image cell then picks the glyph whose
coverage matches its darkness. Tone is *which glyph* (how much contour packs into
the cell), never stroke thickness — same laser rule as every other mode.

**Edge-direction aware.** With `--glyph-edge > 0`, any cell sitting on a coherent
edge instead picks the **directional glyph whose stroke best aligns with that
edge** (reusing the same structure-tensor field as `flow`), blended against the
tonal match by the edge strength. It shines with the `boxdraw` palette, whose
`─ │ ╱ ╲ ┼` glyphs get tagged by angle and snap to the form's contours.

```bash
# density ramp — classic ASCII look
python linify.py sample.png -o glyph.svg --mode glyph --glyph-palette ascii --glyph-cols 100

# edge-aware line drawing with box-drawing glyphs
python linify.py sample.png -o glyph.svg --mode glyph \
    --glyph-palette boxdraw --glyph-edge 0.8 --glyph-cols 90

# your own character set from a glyph-archive export
python linify.py sample.png -o glyph.svg --mode glyph \
    --glyph-json ~/Downloads/utf-8-collection.json --glyph-cols 80
```

- **`--glyph-palette`** is a built-in set — `ascii` (` .:-=+*#%@`), `blocks`
  (shades `░▒▓█`), `boxdraw` (directional lines), or `favorites` (a set bundled
  from a [glyph-archive](https://mrinalghosh.github.io/glyph-archive/) export).
  Any palette is re-sorted by *measured* coverage, so ordering is font-honest.
- **`--glyph-chars " .:-=+*#%@"`** or **`--glyph-json FILE`** override the palette
  with an explicit set (JSON accepts a glyph-archive export: `custom` + `favorites`
  codepoints). Glyphs missing from the font stack are dropped automatically.
- **`--glyph-edge`** `0` is pure density; `0.5–1` biases edge cells toward
  aligned strokes. **`--glyph-edge-threshold`** gates how strong an edge must be
  before a directional swap is allowed.
- **`--glyph-cols`** sets detail; **`--glyph-gamma`** lifts midtones;
  **`--glyph-size`** / **`--glyph-aspect`** tune glyph fill and cell shape;
  **`--glyph-font`** points at a specific `.ttf`/`.otf` (default is a macOS font
  stack: Apple Symbols → Arial Unicode → Menlo → STIX, first hit per character).

Shade glyphs (the `blocks` palette) rasterize to *many* tiny contours, so they're
path-heavy — great tone, larger files; `ascii` / `boxdraw` / `favorites` stay
lean.

**`--glyph-instance`** shrinks path-heavy grids further: instead of repeating a
glyph's outline in every cell, it defines each distinct glyph once in `<defs>`
and drops one `<use transform="translate(…)">` per cell. On a dense grid that's
commonly a 3–5× smaller file (the bundled sample: 1.45 MB → ~280 KB), and the
resolved geometry is identical to within the 0.01 mm coordinate grid. The catch
is it relies on SVG `<use>`/`<defs>`: Inkscape and Illustrator flatten them on
import, but some importers don't — notably older **Affinity Designer** ignored
the `x`/`y` attributes on `<use>` (this uses `transform="translate"`, the form
Affinity's own fix adopted, but **verify a proof in your importer before a real
cut**). Off by default; it lives under **Advanced** in the web UI.

## Background masking

`--mask-threshold T` skips drawing anywhere the (effective) brightness is above
`T`, so a near-white background (e.g. a horse on white) produces **no lines** —
only the subject is drawn. `--invert` flips the tonal encoding *and* what counts
as background, so masking still "respects invert".

```bash
python linify.py horse.png -o horse.svg --mode wavy --mask-threshold 0.92
```

## Verifying the output

```bash
python linify.py sample.png -o out.svg --mode wavy
head -4 out.svg          # -> width="200mm" height="250mm" viewBox="0 0 200 250"
```

Hairline strokes are (by design) nearly invisible in a browser at screen scale;
that's correct for a laser. To eyeball the geometry, temporarily bump the width:

```bash
sed 's/stroke-width="0.02"/stroke-width="0.3"/' out.svg > preview.svg
rsvg-convert -w 600 preview.svg -o preview.png   # or just open preview.svg
```

## Optional: local web UI

A tiny Flask server for dialing in parameters visually — upload an image, pick a
mode, drag sliders (or type exact values into the paired number boxes), see the
SVG update live, then download it. Extras beyond the CLI ergonomics:

- **Units selector** (mm / in / cm) — set the width in your unit and the file
  exports with a matching header, so it imports at true scale in inch-only tools.
- **Source-named downloads** — the file saves as `<input-name>_<mode>.svg`
  (e.g. `portrait_wavy.svg`), not a generic name.
- **Advanced panel** — exposes the finer knobs (`samples`, `resample`,
  `decimate`, `stroke-width`, `freq-amount`) for granular tuning.
- **Glyph palette import** — in `glyph` mode, an **Import JSON…** button loads a
  [glyph-archive](https://mrinalghosh.github.io/glyph-archive/) export as a custom
  character set (parsed in the browser), with a link straight to the archive.

```bash
pip install flask
python server.py                 # -> http://127.0.0.1:5001
PORT=8080 python server.py       # override the port if you like
```

> On macOS, port 5000 is taken by the AirPlay Receiver (it returns 403 and looks
> like a crash), so the server defaults to **5001**.

## segment — image → editable segmentation-mask SVG

A **sibling tool** to linify that does the opposite thing on purpose: instead of
hairline line art, it produces **filled, multi-colour region shapes** you can
drop straight into Inkscape and edit by hand. It uses
[MobileSAM](https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM) (a ~40 MB distilled
Segment Anything model) to find objects, traces each mask to a vector contour,
and writes one labelled `<path>` per region.

> This deliberately breaks linify's laser invariant (`fill:none`, one colour,
> tone-by-geometry) — which is exactly why it lives in its own file rather than
> as a linify `--mode`. It reuses linify's mm-grid path encoders, so output still
> imports at true physical scale.

**Install** (heavier than linify — pulls in PyTorch):

```bash
pip install torch torchvision opencv-python timm flask
pip install git+https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM.git
# weights (~40 MB):
curl -L -o weights/mobile_sam.pt \
  https://github.com/ChaoningZhang/MobileSAM/raw/master/weights/mobile_sam.pt
```

**CLI — automatic "segment everything":**

```bash
python segment.py photo.jpg -o mask.svg
python segment.py photo.jpg -o mask.svg --color mean --max-regions 40 --layers
```

Each region becomes a separately selectable object in Inkscape's Objects panel
(`id` + `inkscape:label`, plus `data-area-mm2` / `data-iou`), under a single
`segmentation` layer — or one layer per region with `--layers`.

Key knobs:

- **`--color`** — `label` (distinct palette, default), `mean` (average image
  colour per region), or `gray` (grayscale ramp).
- **`--max-regions N`** — keep only the N largest regions.
- **`--dedup-iou`** (default `0.7`) — SAM emits nested masks (a whole shape *and*
  a sub-part); this drops any mask that overlaps a larger kept one above the
  threshold. Set `0` to keep everything.
- **`--min-area`** — drop regions below this fraction of the image.
- **`--simplify`** — contour decimation tolerance in mm.
- **`--points-per-side`** — SAM's sampling grid density (more = more/smaller
  regions, slower).

> Runs on **CPU** — MobileSAM's automatic generator feeds float64 point tensors
> that Apple's MPS backend rejects, so MPS isn't auto-picked. Expect tens of
> seconds for a typical image.

**Interactive — click-to-pick** (`segment_server.py`):

```bash
python segment_server.py           # -> http://127.0.0.1:5002
PORT=8080 python segment_server.py
```

Upload an image, then **left-click objects to include** them and **shift-click to
exclude** (carve the mask back); **Add region** freezes each mask, and **Download
SVG** writes them all out. Same output format as the CLI. Unlike the automatic
generator, the prompted predictor casts prompts to float32, so this UI runs on
**Apple MPS** when available.
